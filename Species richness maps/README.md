Raster maps of empirical (empirical_richness) and simulated species richneess (null_richness), respectively at 0.25 (025deg) and 1.0 degree (1deg) spatial resolution.

The null models have different assumptions about range linearity and patchiness.
Null Model 1 (nm1) has the fewest constraints, as the species can disperse anywhere on the map from the starting position. This null model tends to generate compact range shapes that are restricted only by the geometric constraints of the continental coastlines. 
In constrast, Null Model 2 (nm2) allows species to disperse only within their minimum and maximum elevational range limits. This constraint generates range shapes that are bound to the spatial configuration of the topographic landscape. The resulting ranges become geographically structured (usually linear, in mountain cordilleras), following the elevational zones of habitats. 
Null Models 3 (nm3) and 4 (nm4) are similar to 1 and 2 but relax the assumption of range coherency, allowing multiple starting positions, one for each disjunct empirical range patch

We reran each null model with range sizes within the mainland realms of the world standardised to match the global range size frequency distribution (RsStd)
